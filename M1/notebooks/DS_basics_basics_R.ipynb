    "The general base-R syntax is, in contrast to other more general-purpose programming language, already very geared towards working with data. MAny slicing/dicing ect. functionalities which for instance in Python require additional libraries (eg. Pandas in Python) are in R (as a dedicated statistical pogramming language) come with R out-of-the-box. However, the traditional R syntax has during the last years been mainly replaced by the tidy-principles pushed by R.Studio and implemented in their ´tidyverse´ ecosystem.\n",

R may warn you about this by saying something like \"The following object(s) are masked from 'package:igraph'\" as you load a package.

    "Base `R` comes with quite some functionality for slicing and dicing data, there also exists a myriad specialized packages for more tricky data manipulation. To read others' code and example as well as to perform some special operations, you all should be able to use standard `R` syntax.\n",

    "\n",
    "The good news is: The efforts of a small set of key-developers (foremost [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/)) has let to the development of the  [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/), an ecosystem of `R` packages particularly designed for data science applications. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, common API, grammar, and data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among the most amazing contributions here is [`dplyr`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/), a grammar of data manipulation, providing a consistent set of verbs that help you solve the most common data manipulation challenges. I use `dplyr` for 90% of my data-manipulation tasks for the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* All the underlying code is runs optimized in `C++`, making it faster than most base `R`\n",
    "* It consistently unifies the grammar of data manipulation to a small set of operations, which can be flexibly combined to master almost every task\n",
    "* It is designed to work neathly with the `%>%` pipe-operator of [magrittr](hhttps://magrittr.tidyverse.org/) (more on that later)\n",
    "* its syntax is very similar to the logic of `SQL` and other data-management languages\n",
    "* It expanded far beoyond its original 5 verbs, and now replaces most base R commands with optimized, clever, and high-performance alternatives\n",
    "* It works neathly with many databases, such as `SQL` (with addon packages `DBI` and `dbplyr`)\n",
    "\n",
    "I will not touch on all packages there, but the complete `tidyverse` covers almost all issues of data manipulation. They all operate under the same logic, are fast, and usually your best choice for almost any given problem. Particularly `dplyr` is enourmeously powerfull, and has a lot more functions than the basics I cover here. So, for every given problem, your first question (to yourself or [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)) should be:\n",
