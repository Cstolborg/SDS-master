    "At ity's core are 5 central verbs of data/manipulation, which are\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `filter()` picks cases based on their values.\n",
    "2. `select()` picks variables based on their names.\n",
    "3. `arrange()` changes the ordering of the rows.\n",
    "4. `mutate()` adds new variables that are functions of existing variables\n",
    "5. `summarise()` reduces multiple values down to a single summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "These all combine naturally with `group_by()` which allows you to perform any operation \"by group\". You can learn more about them in `vignette(\"dplyr\")`. As well as these single-table verbs, dplyr also provides a variety of two-table verbs (joins and mutations), which you can learn about in `vignette(\"two-table\")`.\n",
