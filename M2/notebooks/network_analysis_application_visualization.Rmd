# Introduction

The main concern in designing a network visualization is the purpose it has to serve. What are the structural properties that we want to highlight? What are the key concerns we want to address?

![](https://sds-aau.github.io/SDS-master/00_media/networks_viz_goal.png){width=500px}

Network maps are far from the only visualization available for graphs - other network representation formats, and even simple charts of key characteristics, may be more appropriate in some cases.

![](https://sds-aau.github.io/SDS-master/00_media/networks_viz_type.png){width=500px}

In network maps, as in other visualization formats, we have several key elements that control the outcome. The major ones are color, size, shape, and position.

# Visualization Basics

```{r}
# We load the highschool network nd make up som characteristics
set.seed(1337)
g <- as_tbl_graph(highschool, directed = TRUE) %E>%
  mutate(weight = sample(1:5, n(), replace = TRUE),
         year = year %>% as.factor()) %N>%
  mutate(class = sample(LETTERS[1:3], n(), replace = TRUE),
         gender = rbinom(n = n(), size = 1, prob = 0.5) %>% as.logical(),
         label = randomNames::randomNames(gender = gender, name.order = "first.last"))
```

```{r,warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, error=FALSE, comment=FALSE}
set.seed(1337)
g <- g %N>%
  mutate(community = group_edge_betweenness(weights = weight, directed = TRUE) %>% as.factor()) %N>%
  filter(!node_is_isolated()) %E>%
  mutate(community_from = .N()$community[from],
         community_to = .N()$community[to])
```

```{r}
g <- g %N>%
  mutate(popular = case_when(
    centrality_degree(mode = 'in') < 5 ~ 'unpopular',
    centrality_degree(mode = 'in') >= 15 ~ 'popular',
    TRUE  ~ 'medium') %>% factor()
    )
```

```{r}
g %N>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  head()
```

## Node Visualization

* Nodes in a network are the entities that are connected. Sometimes these are also referred to as vertices. 
* While the nodes in a graph are the abstract concepts of entities, and the layout is their physical placement, the node geoms are the visual manifestation of the entities. 

### Node positions

* Conceptually one can simply think of it in terms of a scatter plot â€” the layout provides the x and y coordinates, and these can be used to draw nodes in different ways in the plotting window. 
* Actually, due to the design of ggraph the standard scatterplot-like geoms from ggplot2 can be used directly for plotting nodes:

```{r}
set.seed(1337)
g %>%
  ggraph(layout = "nicely") + 
    geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y))
```

* The reason this works is that layouts (about which we talk in a moment) return a `data.frame` of node positions and metadata and this is used as the default plot data:

```{r}
set.seed(1337)
g_layout <- g %>% create_layout(layout = "nicely") %>% select(x,y) 
```

```{r}
g_layout %>% head()
```
* While usage of the default `ggplot2` is theoreticlly fine, `ggraph` practically comes with its own set of node geoms (`geom_node_*()`). 
* They by default already inherit the layout x and y coordinates, and come with extra features for network visualization.
* `ggraph` also comes with an own plotting theme (`theme_graph()`), which optimizes for graph visualization, and we might want to use.

```{r}
g %>% ggraph(layout = g_layout) + 
  geom_node_point() +
  theme_graph()
```

* Usually (but not always) when visualizing a network, we are interested in the connectivity structure as expressed by the interplay between nodes and edges. 
* So, lets also plot the edges (the geometries from the `geom_edge_*` family, about which we talk in a moment)

```{r}
g %>% ggraph(layout = g_layout) + 
  geom_node_point() + 
  geom_edge_link(alpha = 0.25) +
  theme_graph()
```

### Size

* Size is the first obvious choice to highlight important (eg. central) nodes on a contineous scale.

```{r}
g %>% ggraph(layout = g_layout) + 
  geom_edge_link(alpha = 0.25) +
  geom_node_point(aes(size = centrality_degree())) +
  theme_graph()
```

### Color

* Color can also be used to visualize importance in a second continuous dimension, or to highlight categorical features

```{r}
g %>% ggraph(layout = g_layout) + 
  geom_edge_link(alpha = 0.25) +
  geom_node_point(aes(color = community)) +
  theme_graph()
```

### Alpha

```{r}
g %>% ggraph(layout = g_layout) + 
  geom_edge_link(alpha = 0.25) +
  geom_node_point(aes(alpha = centrality_degree())) +
  theme_graph()
```

### Shapes

* In case we want to express even more categorical characteristics, we can also (just like in the visualiation of tabular data) use node shapes.

```{r}
shapes() 
```

```{r}
g %>% ggraph(layout = g_layout) + 
  geom_edge_link(alpha = 0.25) +
  geom_node_point(aes(shape = gender)) +
  theme_graph() 
```

### Labels

* With the `geom_node_text` geometry, we can also ad labels to the node. They are subject to common aestetics.

```{r}
g %>% ggraph(layout = g_layout) + 
  geom_edge_link(alpha = 0.25) +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = label)) +
  theme_graph() 
```

In large graphs, plotting labels can appear messy, so it might make sense to only focus on important nodes to label

```{r}
g %>% ggraph(layout = g_layout) + 
  geom_edge_link(alpha = 0.25) +
  geom_node_point() +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = label), repel = TRUE) +
  theme_graph() 
```

* Still looks like too much. If we want to highlight only certain important nodes with label, we can also only plot them.
* Note that (very practical) all `ggraph` geoms have a `filter` aestetic we can use for that


```{r}
g %>% ggraph(layout = g_layout) + 
  geom_edge_link(alpha = 0.25) +
  geom_node_point() +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = label, 
                     filter = centrality_degree() >= centrality_degree()  %>% quantile(0.9)), 
                 repel = TRUE) +
  theme_graph() 
```

### Combined node visualization tools

```{r}
g %>% ggraph(layout = g_layout) + 
  geom_edge_link(alpha = 0.25) +
  geom_node_point(aes(size = centrality_eigen(), 
                      color = community,
                      shape = gender)) +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = label, 
                     filter = centrality_eigen() >= centrality_eigen() %>% quantile(0.90)), 
                 repel = TRUE) +
  theme_graph() +
  theme(legend.position = 'none')
```


## Edge Visualization

* So, now that we captured nodes, lets see how we can highlight aspects of edges, which are visualized with the geometries of the `geom_edge_*` family.

### Weight

* Obviously, the edge weight (=thickness)

```{r}
g %>% ggraph(layout = g_layout) + 
  geom_edge_link(aes(width = weight), alpha = 0.25) +
  scale_edge_width() +
  geom_node_point() +
  theme_graph() 
```

* Unfortunately, I wind the default to thick. We can also scale it.

```{r}
g %>% ggraph(layout = g_layout) + 
  geom_edge_link(aes(width = weight), alpha = 0.25) +
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 2)) + 
  geom_node_point() +
  theme_graph() 
```

### Color

* Color can also be used to highlight edge significance (continuous)
* However, color is more often used to highlight different edge categories.
* Notice, since we want to represent the colors of potentially multiple edges between a node pair, I now use the `geom_edge_fan` geometry.

```{r}
g %>% ggraph(layout = g_layout) + 
  geom_edge_fan(aes(size = weight,
                     color = year), alpha = 0.25) +
  geom_node_point() +
  theme_graph() 
```

### Density

* Density plots can also be used to highlight densely connected regions.

```{r}
g %>% ggraph(layout = g_layout) + 
  geom_edge_link(aes(col = year), alpha = 0.1) +
  geom_edge_density(aes(fill = year)) +
  geom_node_point() +
  theme_graph() 
```

### Directionality

* The easiest way to express directionality is by defining the `arrow()`, which comes with own aestetics.

```{r}
g %>% ggraph(layout = g_layout) + 
  geom_edge_fan(aes(color = year), 
                arrow = arrow(),
                alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_node_point() +
  theme_graph() 
```

* The default open arrow and other settings are a bit ugly, so we use some adittional aestetics

```{r}
g %>% ggraph(layout = g_layout) + 
  geom_edge_fan(aes(color = year), 
                arrow = arrow(type = "closed", length = unit(2, "mm")),
                start_cap = circle(1, "mm"),
                end_cap = circle(1, "mm"),
                alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_node_point() +
  theme_graph() 
```

* Another nice trick is to work with alphas or colors, which change between start and end node.

```{r}
g %>%
  ggraph(layout = g_layout) + 
  geom_edge_fan(aes(color = year,
                    alpha = stat(index)) # Notice that
                ) +
  geom_node_point() +
  theme_graph() + 
  scale_edge_alpha("Edge direction", guide = "edge_direction")
```

* It can also be really practical to change edge characteristics by the characteristics of their adjacent nodes. 
* Remember, with `.N()`, we can access them to do so.

```{r}
set.seed(1337)
g %>%
  ggraph(layout = 'nicely') + 
  geom_edge_fan(aes(color = .N()$community[from]), # Notice that
                alpha = 0.5,
                show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_node_point(aes(color = community),
                  show.legend = FALSE) +
  theme_graph() 
```


## Layouts

* The graph layout refers to the node position on the reference system.

### Ordinary graph style

* Graphs can be represented in simple geometries such as squares, circles, lines, or randomly.
* Or, specialized algorithms can be used to position nodes according to the properties of their connectivity.
* They are usually designed to highlight different aspects of the network.
* Lets inspect some standard layouts

```{r, fig.height=30, fig.width= 20}
set.seed(1337)
library(ggpubr)
layout_list <- c("randomly", "linear", "circle", 
                 "grid", "fr", "kk", 
                 "graphopt", "stress", 'mds', 
                 'dh', 'drl', 'lgl')

g_list <- list(NULL)
for(i in 1:length(layout_list)){
  g_list[[i]] <-g %>% 
    ggraph(layout = layout_list[i]) + 
  geom_edge_fan(aes(color = year,
                    width = weight,
                    alpha = weight), 
                arrow = arrow(type = "closed", length = unit(2, "mm")),
                start_cap = circle(1, "mm"),
                end_cap = circle(1, "mm"),
                show.legend = FALSE) +
    scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 0.5)) + 
    geom_node_point(aes(size = centrality_degree(mode = 'in'), 
                        color = community,
                        shape = gender),
                    show.legend = FALSE) +
    theme_graph() +
    labs(title = paste("Layout:", layout_list[i], sep = " "))
}

ggarrange(plotlist = g_list, nrow = 4, ncol = 3)
```


### Arcs and circles

```{r}
# An arc diagram
g %>% ggraph(layout = 'linear') + 
  geom_edge_arc() +
  geom_node_point(aes(size = centrality_degree(), 
                      color = community),
                  show.legend = FALSE) +
    theme_graph() 
```

```{r}
# An arc diagram
g %>% ggraph(layout = 'linear', circular = TRUE) + 
  geom_edge_arc() +
  geom_node_point(aes(size = centrality_degree(), 
                      color = community),
                  show.legend = FALSE) +
    theme_graph() +
  coord_fixed()
```

### Hive plots

* A hive plot, while still technically a node-edge diagram, is a bit different from the rest as it uses information pertaining to the nodes, rather than the connection information in the graph. 
* This means that hive plots, to a certain extent are more interpretable as well as less vulnerable to small changes in the graph structure. 
* They are less common though, so use will often require some additional explanation.

```{r}
g %>%
  ggraph(layout = 'hive', axis = popular, sort.by = centrality_degree(mode = 'in')) + 
    geom_edge_hive(aes(colour = year, alpha = ..index..), show.legend = FALSE) + 
    geom_axis_hive(aes(colour = popular), size = 3, label = FALSE) + 
    coord_fixed() + 
  theme_graph() +
  theme(legend.position = 'bottom')
```

### Social Fabric

```{r}
g %>% ggraph(layout = 'fabric', sort.by = community) + 
  geom_node_range(aes(colour = community), alpha = 0.3) + 
  geom_edge_span(aes(col = .N()$community[to]), end_shape = 'circle', alpha = 0.5) + 
  coord_fixed() + 
  theme_graph() +
  theme(legend.position = 'none')
```


## Visualizing Hirarchical networks

* If the network is by definition hierarchical, edges can only exist between nodes of higher to lower dept (eg. tree structures).
* This offers us possibility for quite some adittional ways of representing it which are geared towards hirarchical (=nested) structures

* Here an example of the dependency structures of the `flare` package

```{r}
edges <- flare$edges
vertices <- flare$vertices %>% arrange(name) %>% mutate(name=factor(name, name))
connections <- flare$imports
```

```{r}
vertices %>% head()
```
```{r}
edges %>% head()
```
```{r}
connections %>% head()
```

```{r}
g_hir <- tbl_graph(vertices, edges)
```

```{r}
g_hir
```

### Tree structures

```{r}
g_hir %>% ggraph('tree') + 
  geom_edge_diagonal() +
  theme_graph()
```


```{r}
g_hir %>% ggraph( 'dendrogram') + 
    geom_edge_elbow() +
  theme_graph()
```

```{r}
g_hir %>% ggraph('dendrogram', circular = TRUE) + 
    geom_edge_elbow() + 
    coord_fixed() +
  theme_graph()
```

```{r}
# The connection object must refer to the ids of the leaves:
from = match(connections$from, vertices$name)
to = match(connections$to, vertices$name)
```


```{r}
g_hir %>% ggraph(layout = 'dendrogram', circular = TRUE) + 
  geom_conn_bundle(data = get_con(from = from, to = to), alpha = 0.1) + 
  #geom_edge_diagonal0() +
  #geom_node_text(aes(filter = leaf, angle = node_angle(x, y), label = shortName),
  # hjust = 'outward', size = 2) +
  coord_fixed() +
  theme_graph()
```

### Non-edge-based 

```{r}
# An icicle plot
g_hir %>% ggraph('partition') + 
  geom_node_tile(aes(fill = depth), size = 0.25) +
  theme_graph()
```

```{r}
# A sunburst plot
g_hir %>% ggraph('partition', circular = TRUE) + 
  geom_node_arc_bar(aes(fill = depth), size = 0.25) + 
  coord_fixed() +
  theme_graph()
```

```{r}
g_hir %>% ggraph('circlepack') + # , weight = size
  geom_node_circle(aes(fill = depth), size = 0.25, n = 50) + 
  coord_fixed() +
  theme_graph()
```




```{r}
g_hir %>% ggraph('treemap') + 
  geom_node_tile(aes(fill = depth), size = 0.25) +
  theme_graph()
```

## Geospatial networks

### Defining a map

```{r}
library(maps)
```

```{r}
map_us <- map_data("usa")
```

```{r}
map_us %>%
  head()
```

### Getting some network data

```{r}
library(anyflights)
```

```{r}
us_airports <- get_airports() %>%
  filter(lat >= 24 & lat <= 49 & lon >= -124 & lon <= -66)  %>%
  rename(name_full = name,
         name = faa)
```

```{r}
us_airports %>% head()
```

```{r}
flights <- get_flights(station = us_airports %>% pull(name), year = 2015, month = 5)
```

```{r}
flights %>% head()
```


```{r}
edges <- flights %>% count(origin, dest, sort = TRUE) %>%
  rename(from = origin, to = dest, weight = n) %>%
  semi_join(us_airports, by = c('from' = 'name')) %>%
  semi_join(us_airports, by = c('to' = 'name')) %>% 
  filter(percent_rank(weight) >= 0.25)
```

```{r}
g_geo <- tbl_graph(nodes = us_airports, edges = edges, directed = TRUE) %N>%
  filter(!node_is_isolated())
```


### Constructing a graph

```{r}
coords <- g_geo %N>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  select(lat, lon) %>%
  rename(x = lon, y = lat)
```

```{r}
g_geo %>%
  ggraph(layout = coords) +
  geom_polygon(data = map_us, aes(x=long, y = lat, group = group), fill = "#CECECE", color = "#515151") + 
  geom_node_point() +
  geom_edge_arc(aes(width = weight,   
                    #alpha = weight,
                    #filter = percent_rank(weight) >= 0.75,
                    circular = FALSE),
                strength = 0.33,
                color = 'chocolate2') +
  scale_edge_width_continuous(range = c(0.1, 1)) +
  geom_node_point(aes(size = centrality_degree(),
                      col = centrality_degree())) + 
  coord_fixed(1.3) + 
  theme_graph() + 
  theme(legend.position = 'none')
```

## Interactive networks

* There are numerous ways to to interactive network visualizations in R
* For the sake of time, I just show you what I find the easiest and most consistent implementation (plotly unfortunately does by now not support ggraph)

```{r}
library(ggiraph)
```


```{r}
g_plot_int <- g %>% 
  ggraph(layout = layout_list[i]) + 
  geom_edge_fan(aes(color = year,
                    width = weight,
                    alpha = weight), 
                arrow = arrow(type = "closed", length = unit(2, "mm")),
                start_cap = circle(1, "mm"),
                end_cap = circle(1, "mm"),
                show.legend = FALSE) +
    scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 0.5)) + 
    geom_node_point(aes(size = centrality_degree(mode = 'in'), 
                        color = community,
                        shape = gender),
                    show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_point_interactive(aes(x, y, # Notice this extra layer
                             tooltip = label, data_id = name, 
                             size = centrality_degree(mode = 'in')), alpha = 0.01) +  
    theme_graph() +
  theme(legend.position = 'none')
```

```{r, fig.height=10, fig.width=10}
girafe(ggobj = g_plot_int, width_svg = 10, height_svg = 10) %>% 
    girafe_options(opts_zoom(max = 10), opts_tooltip(opacity = 0.7) )
```
