```{r setup, include=FALSE}
### Generic preamble
rm(list=ls())
Sys.setenv(LANG = "en") # For english language
options(scipen = 5) # To deactivate annoying scientific number notation

### Knitr options
library(knitr) # For display of the markdown
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning=FALSE,
                     message=FALSE,
                     comment=FALSE, 
                     fig.align="center"
                     )
```

### Load standardpackages
library(tidyverse) # Collection of all the good stuff like dplyr, ggplot2 ect.
library(magrittr) # For extra-piping operators (eg. %<>%)
```

### This session

In this applied session, you will:

1. Refresh basic string manipulation skills
2. Learn how to tokenize texts and analyze these tokens
3. xxx


* Now, that we have some experience with short texts, let's try out to work with longer texts. 
* We will be analysing a newspaper article as well as a whole (very long) book. 
* We will continue using more of the `tidytext` functionality.
* However, we will also introduce `Spacy`, a high-level DeepLearning based NLP library that will help us to do complex stuff with not too much code 

# Exploring 'Crime and Punishment'

Let's raise the bar with some **Fyodor Dostoevsky**

```{r}
library(tidytext)
```

```{r}
# We first need to get the book text. It can be conveniently retrieved via the gutenbergr library, linking r to the Gutenberg project
library(gutenbergr)
```

```{r}
# check the id of crime and punishment
gutenberg_metadata %>%
  filter(title == "Crime and Punishment")
```

```{r}
text <- gutenberg_download(2554)
```

```{r}
text %>% head()
```
```{r}
text_tidy <- text %>%
  slice(-c(1:102)) %>%
  mutate(line_num = row_number(),# create new variable line_num
         part = cumsum(str_detect(text, regex("^PART [\\divxlc]",
                                                  ignore_case = TRUE)))) %>% # create variable part: Crime and Punishment has 7 parts %>%
         group_by(part) %>%
         mutate(chapter = cumsum(str_detect(text, regex("^CHAPTER [\\divxlc]",
                                                          ignore_case = TRUE)))) %>% # create new variable number of Chapter per part %>%
         ungroup()
```
















# Entity extraction with `RSpacy`

Here a nice [cheat-sheet
](https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog/spacy-cheatsheet)
Spacy is today one of the leading solutions for NLP in industry which goes as far as them hosting a [whole conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNPwRPg9BrQ&list=PLBmcuObd5An4UC6jvK_-eSl6jCvP1gwXc) with the leading NLP experts worldwide in Berlin last summer

I will introduce you to some functionality but not all. There is an advanced course on SpaCy that can be found on DC.
