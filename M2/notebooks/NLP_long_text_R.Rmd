 Long texts and extracting some linguistic features

* Now, that we have some experience with short texts, let's try out to work with longer texts. 
* We will be analysing a newspaper article as well as a whole (very long) book. 
* We will continue using more of the `tidytext` functionality.
* However, we will also introduce `Spacy`, a high-level DeepLearning based NLP library that will help us to do complex stuff with not too much code

Here a nice [cheat-sheet
](https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog/spacy-cheatsheet)
Spacy is today one of the leading solutions for NLP in industry which goes as far as them hosting a [whole conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNPwRPg9BrQ&list=PLBmcuObd5An4UC6jvK_-eSl6jCvP1gwXc) with the leading NLP experts worldwide in Berlin last summer

I will introduce you to some functionality but not all. There is an advanced course on SpaCy that can be found on DC.
